# Resizable Geofence

Use this if you need to replicate iOS's Reminder App like geofence UI. This is easy to use component, I have used gestures, MKCircle and a little bit of CoreGraphics to achieve the desired layout design.

### How to use:
1. You can just drag and drop the code to your project.
2. Configure the min/max radius range and step value according to your need.
3. Enjoy!

### Pre-development

Before starting to develop this component I looked over the internet, StackOverflow and other sites when I could not find any suitable code that I could use, I was bound to create my own resizable geofence component.


### Post-development

This is our final output.

Note, this was developed on specific requirements for one of my projects.
